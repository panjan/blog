The awesome [Glowing Mirror Mask tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/glowing-mirror-mask/introduction) by Adafruit inspired me to make this Halloween mask. It still makes use of the [infinity mirror efect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_mirror). The main differences are that I used a cool alien design and cheaper parts. Also, the design is printed (not cut into vinyl) which allows us to use any shapes without too much effort.

## Parts and Materials

All of the parts can be ordered from eBay or AliExpress.

- [alien vector image](https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/sign-of-space-aliens-gm906014358-249808396) (â‚¬9)
- 5V RGB individually addressable LED strip
- Wemos D1 Mini (I recommend to order at least two)
- Wemos battery shield
- 3.7V lithium battery with a connector
- male-male jumper cables
- breadboard
- shrink tubes
- holographic foil or paper
- one-way mirror foil
- silicone glue
- craft felt
- flexible strip

## Required Skills

You should have these skills:

- using a breadboard
- soldering
- sewing
- programming the Wemos board using Arduino IDE (at least blink a led)

There are plenty of tutorials on these topics. You can do this project without prior experience but don't expect it to be a weekend project then.

## Tools

- hot air gun, hair drier or lighter (for shrink tubes)
- hot glue gun
- needle and thread
- soldering iron
- utility knife
- wire cutter
- scissors

> Before you start with this project make sure you understand the risks of working with electronics and lithium batteries (they blow up if shorted!). The mask is not waterproof.

## Flashing Wemos D1 Mini

We'll be using the Wemos D1 Mini board for controlling the LEDs. I use this board for nearly every electronics project because it has a WIFI chip, mini-USB port and it's very affordable.

Flash the Wemos using Arduino IDE. We'll be using the [Adafruit Neopixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) to control the LEDs. Start with [this example code](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel/blob/master/examples/strandtest/strandtest.ino) which loops between different effects. Make sure you edit the pin number and number of pixels in the strip.

> A common pitfall in flashing the Wemos board is not having [drivers for the USB to serial converter](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers).

## Light Up the LEDs

First, solder headers to the Wemos to make it breadboard-compatible. Then connect the LED strip according to the following diagram. You can power the Wemos directly through USB to save battery.

*First test of the infinity mirror effect. Wow!*

There might be 2 extra cables running from the LED strip. They are meant for external power supply. You don't need them as Wemos has a 5V output. Make sure to isolate them though.

## Choosing Design

Now it's time to choose a design for your mask. I've chosen [this vector image](https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/sign-of-space-aliens-gm906014358-249808396) because it has wide edges that perfectly hide the LEDs so they don't shine directly in your eyes. I used the free SVG editor [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) to erase the background. The â‚¬9 price seems reasonable for the time it saved me. If you're adventurous, make or buy a different design.

## Making the Front Layer

Print the mask on an A4 transparent self-adhesive foil. You can do this at home if you have a suitable printer and transparency foil. I had it done at a local copy centre. Make sure you crop the image as much as possible so that there are no margins on the sides. For an adult-sized mask, the A4 format is just wide enough. First, try printing the image on an ordinary paper if you don't want to risk wasting a transparency foil.

*This is how the image looks printed on a transparency foil.*

Stick the transparency foil to the one-way mirror foil. First, peel the thin strip on the edge of the transparency foil. Align it with the edge of your mirror foil. Continuously peel the rest of the sticker and apply pressure to avoid air bubbles.

Use a utility knife to cut out the mask.

## Making the Back Layer

Use the front layer as a template to cut out the felt and holographic foil layers. Keep the felt left-overs. You'll use them to cover the Wemos board later.

![holographic foil and felt](/assets/alien_holographic_felt.jpeg)

Use your hot glue gun to glue the two layers together.

I found out that the front layer should be slightly bigger than the back layer. The mask is going to be bent and the front layer would be stretched if we didn't make it bigger. Cut off the edges of the back layer based on how much you're going to bend the mask.

## Cut Out Holes for Eyes

Cut holes for eyes through both the front and back layer. I've cut them above the "eyebrows" of the alien. I was afraid that the holes would look bad so I made them quite small. It doesn't look bad at all and I should have made them bigger as it's quite hard to see with the mask on. Make sure you can see clearly through the mask even when it's dark.

## Attaching the LED Strip

Use tape to keep the mask bent. Sew the LED strip to the edge of the back layer. Leave a small margin between the LED strip and the edge so that the LED strip doesn't slide off the back layer.

When you're about to close the loop, cut off the excess of the LED strip using scissors. Make sure you cut the strip exactly in the marked area. Cut a hole for the connector and pull it through. Use jumper cables to connect your Wemos and check that everything is still working.

Isolate the end of the LED strip using a shrink tube. Squeeze the end with pliers as in the picture below.

## Attaching the Front Layer

Glue the front layer to the LED strip using silicone glue. Use tape to hold everything together. Wait until the next day to let the glue dry completely.

*You can see tape holding the mask together while the silicon glue dries.*

## Connecting the Board

Solder cables according to the wiring diagram. Strengthen the connections using a hot glue gun. Don't apply the glue to the board like in the picture (silly me), but rather glue the cables to the mask. That will relieve stress from the connections even better. Sew Wemos to the inside of the mask. Isolate the unused LED strip power cables if there are any.

## Charging the Battery

You're going to charge the battery using the Wemos battery shield. Make sure you don't connect the battery the other way around, otherwise you'll burn the board and see the [magic blue smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke).

## Final Touches

Cover the Wemos with the left-over felt. Use hot glue gun to attach it. Allow for access to the USB port.

Sew a flexible strip to the mask and enjoy!

The next step might be building a web client for switching effects. It's perfectly possible with the Wemos D1 Mini board and it would be cool to control the mask using a phone. Maybe next year. ðŸŽƒ
