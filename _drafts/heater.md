This article will show you how to make your ordinary electric heater smarter and connect it to Home Assistant. You'll be able to control it remotely over WiFi, set timers and go crazy with automations in Home Assistant.

## Parts and Materials

- electric heater
- Sonoff POW
- 1.5mm2 3 core wire

## Tools

- wire cutter
- utility knife
- pencil
- electric drill
- needle nose pliers for manipulating cables (optional)
- multimeter?

## Wiring

We are going to connect the Sonoff according to the following diagram. For that, we're going to need extra cables and a hole in the skirting board for the cables.

First, take off the skirting board and place the Sonoff against it in the right angle. Use a pencil to mark the hole for the cables an cut it as in the picture below.

Now take the plastic cover off of the socket. Measure how much cable you're going to need to connect the Sonoff to the socket. Leave some extra length and cut your 3 core wire. Remove a bit of the outer insulation and use pliers to pull out the three wires.

Before we start fiddling with the wiring, take out your phone and take a picture of the socket connections.
