I'm a programmer who's exploring the world of hardware and documenting his projects on this blog. As many other electronics enthusiasts, I've encountered the [magic blue smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_smoke) more than once and even decided to name my blog after the phenomenon.

If you'd like to learn more about me, take a look at [my personal webpage](http://honza.me) or shoot an email to [hi@honza.me](mailto:hi@honza.me).
